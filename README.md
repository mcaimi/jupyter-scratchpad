# JupyterHub Scratchpad

A place where I dump all experiments/notebooks/code scraps that I wrote while learning AI/ML and Jupyter

- gan-example: Simple Generative Adversarial Network that is trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset. Integrates Kaggle for Datasets and Weights and Biases for monitoring.
- facegan: More interesting example of a GAN based on Convolutional Neural Networks, trained on the celeb-a dataset. Still integrates Weights and Biases for monitoring.

## TODO

- Better comments....
- Upload more examples
